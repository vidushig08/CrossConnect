# crossconnect

## Problem Statement:
This project will solve the problem of Non Government Organisations(NGOs) not being able to help the people due to their inability in reaching out to them on time. The similar scenario took place during the Nation-wide Lockdown last year when thousands of workers and laborers had to migrate to different places with minimal assistance during the course of their journey. So to avoid any chaotic situation like that as well as the minor ones happening very frequently, we thought of a well designed solution.

## Solution:
crossconnect is a web application to cater to the needs of the migrant workers (be it medical, financial, educational or even provide them with long term solutions) when they move from one place to another. This Web App will let the Non Government Organisations(NGOs) reach out to these migrant workers, (that is, CONNECT by CROSSING through this website), by collecting their travel information from time to time.
