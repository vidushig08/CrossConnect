# CrossConnect

## Abstract:
1. It is a web application to cater to the needs of the migrant workers (be it medically, financially or even provide them with long term solutions) when they move from one place to another. This web app will let the Non Government Organisations(NGOs) reach out to the these migrant workers, (that is, CONNECT), by collecting their travel info from time to time.
2. This project will solve the problem of NGOs not being able to help the people due to the lack of their efficiency in reaching out to them on time.
